## Pokemon Application
The Pokemon Application is an internship project for PT Gravel Indonesia's take home assignment. In this project, we can see the full list and details on Pokemon API data (https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2).

The technology that I used for this project, including:
- Next.Js (React.Js Framework)
- Bootstrap (CSS Framework)
- Axios (Http Client Library)

## Getting Started
To run the project, you can first clone this repository. After that, you can install dependencies on this project, by running a command like the following:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

After this, you can open the website project on the local server. By default, the local server used is http://localhost:3000/

## Deployment
I did deployment using Vercel and the website can be accessed with the url https://pokemon-app-rho-weld.vercel.app/
